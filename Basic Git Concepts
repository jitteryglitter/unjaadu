Basic Git Concepts

1. Repositories
2. Committing
3. Branches
4. Pulling/Pushing

Let's understand each of them:
1. Repositories: Storage. Place where the project and its tracking is stored. There are two repos -- local and remote and the name of the game is to keep them synced.
2. Committing: This can mean multiple things but all conceptually synonymous. Its a record of major or minor accomplishments. Its also a project satte that you may want to return to.
3. Branches: Think of it as Save As version of your project
4. Pulling/Pushing: Push to remote and Pull from remote.
